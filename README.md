# WorkDaySchedular
Purpose/What is it?:
	The work day scheduler is an application that allows the user to schedule events on 8 hour work day time frame. 
	This application enables the user to schedule their work day easily.

How to use and what do the different colors mean?:
	The header includes the current date and time, time is updated by the second.
	Each hour on the work day is designated a row, with a save button.
	It's conveniently color coded, so user can easily see the past, present and future events(See screenshot below).


It also saves the scheduler on local storage, so as to retain saved entries. 
Even after a refresh, or if the tab or page is closed, the user can access the page and see their saved entries

To Use:
Enter your event on the time row, and click save.
the color on the row will dynamically change to past/present/future color based on timeframe condition for the same.
